<h2><a name="TLEs"></a><a name="intro"></a>Brief Introduction To TLEs And
Satellite IDs</h2>

<BR>

<p>Keplerian or Two-Line Element Sets (TLEs) are distributed in the form shown
in the example below: </p>

<b>THOR ABLESTAR R/B 1</b><br>
1 00047U 60007C 96198.95303667 -.00000008 +00000-0 +24803-4 005026 2<br>
2 00047 066.6626 011.9766 0252122 190.4009 169.1818 14.34618735877842

<p>Line 0 (the top line) provides the<b> catalog and/or common name</b> of the
satellite object. Not all TLEs have common names associated with them, but they
are an additional enhancement provided by some TLE distributors to allow the
tracking program to provide a common name for the satellite in addition to the
Satellite Catalog Number and/or International ID. Note, "R/B is an OIG
acronym for "rocket body". </p>

<p>The<b> epoch date</b> is the third element <b>(96198.95303667)</b> in line 1
of the TLE. The epoch is the sequential calendar date when the satellite
crossed the equator in an ascending (northerly) direction subsequent to a
series of observations that were made to calculate the elements. In the above
example, observations were made near the time on which the satellite was
calculated to have crossed the equator on calendar date 198.95303667 in the
year 1996. Universal Time (UT), formally known as Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), is
the time standard used. Jim Varney explains the concept in a response to a
question found in the <a href="http://satobs.org/seesat/Mar-1997/0094.html">SeeSat-L</a>
e-mail archive. </p>

<p>Specifically, the equatorial crossing was calculated for day 198 of the year
1996 at 22:52 UT [24 (hours) x 0.95303667 = 22.87288 hours, and 60 (minutes) x
0.87288 = 52.3728 minutes]. Most tracking programs will inform the user how old
the element is by using the epoch date element. This tells the user if an old
and possibly unreliable TLE is being used. </p>

THOR ABLESTAR R/B 1<br><b>
1 00047U 60007C 96198.95303667 -.00000008 +00000-0 +24803-4 005026 2</b><br>
2 00047 066.6626 011.9766 0252122 190.4009 169.1818 14.34618735877842

<p><a name="catno">The</a> first element in line 1 <b>(00047U)</b> and in line 2 <b>(00047)</b>
is the<b> Satellite Catalog Number</b> assigned by USSPACECOM. The <b>"U"</b>
designates the element as unclassified or for public distribution. The official
title for this identifier is "Satellite Catalog Number". However,
many acronyms are used because of their brevity and past history of use. These
include NORAD (North American Air Defense), NSSC (NORAD Space Surveillance
Center), Cat # (Catalog Number), Object Number, USSPACECOM (US Space Command)
number, and so on. </p>

<p>Thus the satellite in the example TLE was 47th satellite ever cataloged by
the USSPACECOM. </p>

<p>"Satellite Catalog Number" comes from the early days of satellite
identification done at Hanscom Field, Massachusetts, USA in the late 1950's,
where they kept track of the satellites they identified, by giving them the
next ascending number in a log that began with the number 00001 for the Sputnik
launch. When NORAD took over the responsibility for tracking, they continued
using the sequence. Now USSPACECOM continues the assignment. </p>

THOR ABLESTAR R/B 1<br><b>
1 00047U 60007C 96198.95303667 -.00000008 +00000-0 +24803-4 005026 2</b><br>
2 00047 066.6626 011.9766 0252122 190.4009 169.1818 14.34618735877842

<p><a name="intdesg">The</a> second element in line 1 <b>(60007C)</b> indicates
the<b> International Designation</b> and corresponds to the numerical format
designation of 60-007C. This indicates a launch in 1960 and it was the 7th
successful orbital launch for that year. "C" designates the third
object catalogued for that launch. Launches in 2000, 2001, 2002 and later start
with 00-xxxx, 01-xxxx, 02-xxxx while launches from 1957 and later until the year 
2000 start with the numbers 57 to 99. The International Designation is also
described by terms such as International ID, <a href="http://cospar.itodys.jussieu.fr/">COSPAR</a> (COmmittee for SPAce
Research) number, and COSPAR/WWAS (COSPAR World Warning Agency for Satellites)
number. The World Warning Agency (WWAS) is the body authorized by the United
Nations to issue the International ID. WWAS issues the International
Designation for the payload but not for any of the other objects placed in
orbit as a result of the launch. Subsequent International Designations for
non-payload objects are normally assigned by USSPACECOM using the same
designation as the payload, but using the next higher English letter in the
alphabet. </p>

THOR ABLESTAR R/B 1<br>
1 00047U 60007C 96198.95303667 -.00000008 +00000-0 +24803-4 005026 2<br><b>
2 00047 066.6626 011.9766 0252122 190.4009 169.1818 14.34618735877842</b>

<p>The second element in Line 2 <b>(066.6626)</b> is the<b> inclination</b> of
the orbit which is measured counter-clockwise from true East to true West . The
values of inclination can be from 0 to 180 degrees. Thus, this satellite will
be seen moving in a NNE direction as it crosses the Earth's equator going in an
ascending direction (south to north). </p>

<p>An inclination of less than 90 degrees would mean that the satellite is in
an orbit less than polar and is in a prograde orbit. That is, the satellite
moving in an easterly direction takes advantage of the Earth's easterly
rotation and requires less energy to be placed into orbit. The minimum energy
needed to place a satellite into orbit would be a launch from the equator in a
due easterly direction. Such a launch would have the satellite have an
inclination of 0 degrees. Additional energy must be expended by the rocket to maneuver
a satellite into an orbital inclination of zero degrees if launched from a latitude
other than zero degrees. </p>

<p>An inclination of 90 degrees would mean the satellite crosses the Earth's
equator at a right angle and crosses both poles in one orbit. </p>

<p>An inclination of greater than 90 degrees would mean that the satellite is
in less than a polar orbit and is in what is called a retrograde orbit. Part of
the motion of the satellite is in the opposite direction of rotation of the
Earth. </p>
