This is an upgrade to OVT2G containing model of electrical potential
over polar regions by Weimer'96.

In ovt2g5upd.zip:

ovt/models/Weimer96.java
ovt/object/GjElectPot.java
ovt/object/editor/GjElectPotPropertyEditor.java
ovt/util/CGMC.java
ovt/util/MyFileReader.java
images/elpot.gif
userdata/w96.dat
cgmc.for
cgmc.def
cgmc.dll
cgmc2.c
cgmc3.h
cgmc4.c
f2c.h
ovt_util_CGMC.h

Files: cgmc.def, cgmc2.c, cgmc3.h, cgmc4.c, f2c.h, and ovt_util_CGMC.h
are sources to compile to cgmc.dll.  I used Borland C++ 5.
File cgmc2.c is result of translation of cgmc.for with use of f2c 
under Linux.  There are the following manual corrections in cgmc2.c:
  1) added function  fill_commons(),
  2) #ifdef __cplusplus / ....    (in two places).
File cgmc4.c contains function DllEntryPoint(), which is specific for
Windows and should be redesigned for the Unix version.
This dll produces data files needed for recalculations of coordinates:
geo <---> corr.geo-mag.  Once calculated, files are placed on userdata/
for farther use.  

The property editor is a demo only.  It should be redesigned.
It should contain the following entries:
- IMF (Bz,By)            (changed to getIMF())
- Dipole tilt angle      (changed to getDipoleTilt())
- Solar wind velocity
- Elect.field izolines resolution step in kV (as in the demo).
All places, where these data are used in file GjElectPot.java
are marked with "//$$$".

The file elpot.gif contains menu icon for Weimer model.  It can
be changed if needed.
